KISS
keep it simple & stupid


home work
1) read about firebase - 
	a. authentication 
	b. hosting
	c. database
2) try to add email + password authentication to our project via firebase
3) add tabs support in main app, one of the tabs will be login the other will be profile-and-friends
4) if you have time - devide profile-and-friends component into 1. profile 2. friends
